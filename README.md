Welcome to **Squiddadle!**, a colorful aquatic adventure where you control a daring squid exploring the open ocean, dodging sharks, collecting fish, and surviving the deep!

## Overview
Squiddadle is a dynamic 2D exploration mobile game built with Unity. You play as a brave squid trying to navigate an evolving underwater environment filled with randomly spawning fish and sharks. Collect fish, avoid danger, and see how long you can survive!

## Gameplay Features
- **Dynamic Spawning:** Fish and sharks spawn based on player location, ensuring a constantly changing environment.
- **Save/Load Mechanic:** Persistent high score and alternate squid appearance are saved using JSON serialization.

- **Custom Audio:** Looping background music and SFX enhance immersion.

## How to Play
